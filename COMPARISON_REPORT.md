# Scouts Fork Divergence Analysis

**Comparison between**: [Cedriccmh/scouts](https://github.com/Cedriccmh/scouts) (fork) vs [TokenRollAI/cc-plugin](https://github.com/TokenRollAI/cc-plugin) (original)

**Date**: October 22, 2025

## TL;DR - Critical Issues

### üö® What the Fork REMOVED:
2. **"Zero subjective judgments" rule** - Weakened objectivity guarantees
3. **Descriptive file naming** - Date-prefix format less informative
4. **Flexible tool usage** - Forced to use semantic-first even when inappropriate

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What the Fork ADDED (Questionable Value):
5. **Mandatory semantic-first** - Slower for simple exact-match queries
7. **Formalized iteration boundaries** - "20% incremental value" is subjective/unmeasurable
8. **Quality checklist** - No enforcement, just overhead

---

## 1. What the Original Has That the Fork Removed

### 1.3 No Content Duplication Rule (REMOVED)

**Original** mandates:
- "Ensure zero overlap between different documents"
- "Each piece of information should appear in exactly one document"
- Clear guidance on handling cross-document relevance

**Fork**: No mention of content duplication control

**Impact**: ‚ùå Potential for redundant information across multiple reports

### 1.4 Descriptive Multi-Word File Naming (REMOVED)

**Original** enforces:
- "MUST use multiple words separated by hyphens"
- Good examples: `how-to-add-api-in-backend-server.md`, `trpc-router-architecture-analysis.md`
- Bad examples: `api.md`, `auth.md`, `analysis.md`

**Fork**: Uses date-prefix format `yy-mm-dd-target.md` where "target" is just a "concise description"

**Impact**: ‚ùå Less descriptive file names, harder to understand content from file name alone

### 1.5 Strict 200-Line Limit (RELAXED)

**Original**: 
- "HARD LIMIT: Maximum 200 lines per document"
- "Longer is NOT better - focus on relevant, non-redundant information"

**Fork**: Increased to 300 lines

**Impact**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential for longer, less focused reports

## 2. What the Original Has in withScout That the Fork Removed


## 3. Unnecessary Complexity Added in the Fork


### 3.2 Step 0: Memory Bank Pre-Check (Premature Optimization)

**Fork adds entire pre-investigation phase**:
1. Read Memory Bank Index
2. Extract relevant pointers
3. Review specific past reports
4. Prepare structured "Known Information" for scouts

**Problems**:
- ‚ùå Adds overhead to every investigation
- ‚ùå Assumes index exists and is up-to-date
- ‚ùå Coordinator (withScout) becomes a bottleneck
- ‚ùå **Original's direct approach was faster for first-time investigations**

### 3.6 Incremental Report Writing (Complexity Workaround)

**Fork mandates**:
- "Write the document in batches (append mode)"
- "First: Metadata & Code Sections"
- "Second: Conclusions & Relations"
- "Third: Result & Attention"
- "NEVER attempt to write everything in a single operation!"

**Why this exists**: Working around 300-line report bloat

**Problems**:
- ‚ùå More tool calls = slower execution
- ‚ùå Risk of incomplete reports if process interrupted
- ‚ùå **Original's 200-line limit allowed single-write reports**

### 3.7 Quality Control Checklist (Bureaucracy)

**Fork adds 5-point quality checklist**:
- Every code section must have file path and line numbers
- 70% of research questions answered
- All findings linked to source
- Relations section shows dependencies
- Attention section highlights risks

**Problems**:
- ‚ùå No clear enforcement mechanism
- ‚ùå Subjective "70%" threshold
- ‚ùå Adds overhead without guaranteed quality improvement
- ‚ùå **Original's "zero subjective judgments" rule was simpler and more effective**

### 3.8 Iteration Boundaries (Formalized Inefficiency)

**Fork formalizes**:
- Maximum 3 rounds
- 20% incremental value threshold
- Convergence checks

**Problems**:
- ‚ùå How do you measure "20% new actionable information"?
- ‚ùå Artificial limits may stop before completion
- ‚ùå Adds calculation overhead
- ‚ùå **Original's flexible iteration worked based on actual need**


### 3.10 6-Section Report Template (Template Bloat)

**Fork requires**:
1. Investigation Summary (with Task Type Rationale, Search Scopes, etc.)
2. Key Findings (subdivided by scout)
3. Cross-Area Connections
4. Knowledge Gaps & Uncertainties
5. Actionable Recommendations
6. Appendix (Scout Deployment History, Evidence Trail)

**Original**: 
- Evidence Section
- Findings Section
- Done.

**Problems**:
- ‚ùå Creates long, bureaucratic reports
- ‚ùå Forces structure even when not needed
- ‚ùå "Knowledge Gaps" section documents what you *don't* know
- ‚ùå **Original's 2-section format was cleaner and more focused**

## 4. Critical Regression Summary

| Feature | Original | Fork | Assessment |
|---------|----------|------|------------|
| **Action Phase** | ‚úÖ Implements/fixes/documents | ‚ùå Only generates reports | üö® **CRITICAL LOSS** |
| **Workflow** | 6 steps, ends with implementation | 5 steps (+ Step 0), ends with report | ‚ùå Regression |
| **File Naming** | Descriptive multi-word | Date-prefix + vague description | ‚ùå Less usable |
| **Report Length** | 200 lines max | 300 lines max | ‚ö†Ô∏è Encourages bloat |
| **Tool Flexibility** | Any tool as needed | Forced semantic-first | ‚ùå Less flexible |
| **Objectivity** | Strong "zero subjective judgments" | Weakened emphasis | ‚ùå Quality risk |
| **Simplicity** | Simple workflow | Complex infrastructure | ‚ùå Higher barrier to entry |
| **Content Duplication** | Explicitly prohibited | No control | ‚ùå Quality risk |
| **Use-Case Examples** | Concrete examples provided | Abstract descriptions | ‚ùå Less clear |

## 5. When Each Version Makes Sense

### Use **Original (TokenRollAI/cc-plugin)** when:

‚úÖ **You want to actually implement features** (not just document them)
‚úÖ You need quick, actionable intelligence
‚úÖ You want objective, fact-based reports
‚úÖ You prefer simple, clear workflows
‚úÖ You're working alone or in small teams
‚úÖ You value execution over documentation
‚úÖ Your codebase is small-to-medium size
‚úÖ You want something that "just works"

### Use **Fork (Cedriccmh/scouts)** when:

‚ö†Ô∏è You only need investigation reports (no implementation)
‚ö†Ô∏è You have time to set up Memory Bank infrastructure
‚ö†Ô∏è You have existing ProjectWiki and SvnLog directories
‚ö†Ô∏è You can maintain index files manually
‚ö†Ô∏è You're building a long-term knowledge base
‚ö†Ô∏è You're willing to trade simplicity for formalization
‚ö†Ô∏è You have semantic search infrastructure available
‚ö†Ô∏è You value process over results

## 6. Conclusion

### The Fundamental Trade-off

The fork **sacrifices practical utility for architectural purity**:

- **Lost**: Action/implementation phase, simplicity, flexibility, clear examples
- **Gained**: Complex infrastructure, formalized processes, bureaucratic overhead

### Critical Finding

**The fork removed the ability to actually do work.** 

The original's workflow:
```
Research ‚Üí Implement ‚Üí Done
```

The fork's workflow:
```
Pre-check ‚Üí Research ‚Üí Report ‚Üí Stop
```

### Recommendation

**For most users, the original (TokenRollAI/cc-plugin) is superior** because:

1. ‚úÖ It actually completes tasks (implements features, fixes bugs)
2. ‚úÖ Simpler to use (4 steps vs. 8 steps + Step 0)
3. ‚úÖ More flexible tool usage
4. ‚úÖ Stronger objectivity guarantees
5. ‚úÖ Clearer documentation with concrete examples
6. ‚úÖ No infrastructure setup required
7. ‚úÖ More focused reports (200 lines vs. 300 lines)

**The fork may be valuable only if**:
- You already have a Memory Bank infrastructure
- You genuinely need investigation-only workflow (no implementation)
- You're building an enterprise knowledge base
- You have dedicated personnel to maintain indices

### Final Verdict

**Choose the original unless you have a specific reason to choose the fork.**

The fork's architectural complexity is **not justified** for most use cases, and the removal of the implementation phase is a **critical regression** that makes the plugin incomplete.
